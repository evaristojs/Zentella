## Testing Tools

### Browser Extensions
- **axe DevTools**: Automated accessibility scanning
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation
- **Colour Contrast Analyser**: Check color contrast ratios
- **Accessibility Insights**: Microsoft's accessibility testing tool

### Screen Readers
- **NVDA** (Windows): Free, widely used
- **JAWS** (Windows): Professional screen reader
- **VoiceOver** (macOS): Built-in screen reader
- **Orca** (Linux): Open source screen reader

### Browser Testing
- **Chrome DevTools**: Lighthouse accessibility audit
- **Firefox DevTools**: Accessibility inspector
- **Safari DevTools**: Accessibility features

## Common Issues to Check

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
1. **Perceivable**
   - Text alternatives for non-text content
   - Sufficient color contrast
   - Responsive design
   - Content not dependent on color alone

2. **Operable**
   - Keyboard accessible
   - No seizure-inducing content
   - Users can control timing
   - Help users navigate and find content

3. **Understandable**
   - Text is readable and understandable
   - Content appears and operates predictably
   - Help users avoid and correct mistakes

4. **Robust**
   - Content can be interpreted reliably by assistive technologies
   - Content remains accessible as technologies advance

## Testing Commands

### Keyboard Navigation Commands
- **Tab**: Move to next interactive element
- **Shift + Tab**: Move to previous interactive element
- **Enter**: Activate links and buttons
- **Space**: Activate buttons
- **Escape**: Close modal dialogs
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate within menus (when implemented)

### Screen Reader Commands (NVDA)
- **Insert + F7**: List all links
- **Insert + F5**: Refresh elements list
- **H**: Navigate by headings
- **B**: Navigate by buttons
- **L**: Navigate by links
- **R**: Navigate by regions/landmarks

## Expected Behavior

### Desktop Navigation
1. Skip link appears on first Tab press
2. Logo receives focus and is announced
3. Navigation items receive focus in order
4. Active page item announced as "current page"
5. Theme toggle activates and announces state change

### Mobile Navigation
1. Menu button receives focus and announces state
2. Menu opens and focus moves inside
3. Close button and menu items are focusable
4. Escape closes menu and returns focus
5. Clicking outside closes menu

## Automated Testing Integration

```javascript
// Example jest test for accessibility
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe'
import { render } from '@testing-library/react'
import Navigation from './Navigation'

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)

test('Navigation should not have accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Navigation />)
  const results = await axe(container)
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```

This comprehensive testing approach ensures the navigation meets modern accessibility standards and provides an excellent user experience for all users, including those using assistive technologies.
